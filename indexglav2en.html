    <h3> <p><b>Olympic Flag</b> - a white silk cloth with five intertwined rings of blue, black, red, yellow and green embroidered on it.
        </p>
       The flag was invented by Pierre de Coubertin in 1913 and presented at the VII Summer Olympics in Antwerp in 1920. The rings symbolize the five parts of the world. However, contrary to popular belief, each of the rings does not refer to any particular continent. Five colors are combined so that they represent the national colors of all countries of the world without exception.
